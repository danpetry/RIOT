 * # TinyCBOR
 * 
 * TinyCBOR is a small CBOR encoder and decoder, optimized for very fast
 * operation with very small footprint.
 *
 * The main encoder and decoder function don't use dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * Just add it as a package in your application:
 *
 * ```makefile
 * USEPKG += tinycbor
 * ```
 *
 * TinyCBOR has optional floating point support. In RIOT-os this is enabled by
 * adding to your application:
 *
 * ```makefile
 * USEMODULE += tinycbor_float
 * ```
